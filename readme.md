# Startup Benefits & Partnerships Platform

## Overview

This project is a full-stack **Startup Benefits Platform** designed to help early-stage startups, indie hackers, and small teams access **exclusive SaaS deals** that are otherwise expensive in the early phase.

The platform clearly differentiates between:
- **Public deals** (available to all users)
- **Locked deals** (available only to verified users)

The focus of this assignment is **product flow clarity, access control, and UI/UX quality**, not feature overload.
